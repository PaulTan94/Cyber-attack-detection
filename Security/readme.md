# Work on security

## DVWA(Damn Vulnerable Web App)

We first use DVWA(Damn Vulnerable Web App) as a testing platform to show the basics of burp. It is a PHP/MySQL web application which is damn vulnerable. Its main goals are to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and aid teachers/students to teach/learn web application security in a class room environment.

However, when we fly in the face of all the set-up information on the [DVWA site](http://www.dvwa.co.uk/), we decide to go down the docker route and it is quite simple, thanks to the inspiring work by [infoslack](https://github.com/infoslack/docker-dvwa), even more elegant than the recommended way using [XAMPP(Apache + MariaDB + PHP + Perl)](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

So how do we realize it? There are only two steps.

### install Docker

Details can be found from this [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04). Briefly speaking, just do the following steps. Our environment is `Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS`.

- install Docker from the official Docker repository.

```shell
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt-get update
apt-cache policy docker-ce
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce
```

- valid docker installation

```shell
sudo systemctl status docker
```

### work with DVWA docker image

- pull docker image

```shell
sudo docker pull infoslack/dvwa
sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 infoslack/dvwa
```
You may also change random mysql password to self-defined one, just type:

```shell
sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_PASS="mypass" infoslack/dvwa
```

- learn DVWA

Just browse to *localhost(127.0.0.1)*, and hit `Create/Reset Database`. Enjoy it :)

- stop DVWA service

```shell
sudo docker ps
sudo docker stop <container-id>
```

## Introduction to Web app attacks
Referring to [OWASP.org](https://www.owasp.org/) and its [Testing guide v3](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Contents), we summarize below some of the common Web application attacks.

### Brute force attack
A brute force attack can manifest itself in many different ways, but primarily consists in an attacker configuring predetermined values, making requests to a server using those values, and then analyzing the response. Brute-force attacks are often used for attacking authentication and discovering hidden content/pages within a web application. These attacks are usually sent via GET and POST requests to the server.

There are different types of brute force attacks depending on the authentication methods of the web application. After having listed the different types of authentication methods for a web application, we will explain several types of brute force attacks below:

- Dictionary Attack
